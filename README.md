# Data Types in Python

## Introduction
Data types in Python define the kind of value a variable can hold. Python has built-in data types that support various kinds of operations.

## Key Concepts
- Python is dynamically typed  
- Data types determine what operations can be performed  
- Type conversion is flexible and often implicit  

## Topics to Learn
- Basic data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`  
- Collection data types: `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`  
- Type casting and conversion  
- Mutable vs Immutable types  
- Checking types using `type()` and `isinstance()`
